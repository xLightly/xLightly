## Hey there 👋, I'm [Irakli!](https://github.com/xLightly/)  

I’m a Backend Developer transitioning from Java to **Go**, with a clear goal: become a **Fullstack Engineer** who builds smart, scalable systems. I’m deeply curious about **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, and I’m actively exploring how they can power intelligent applications.

By day, I design robust backend services with **Gin** (and sometimes **Spring** for legacy love 💛).  
By night — I dive into **Unreal Engine 4/5**, crafting games in **C++**. Game development isn’t just a hobby; it’s my creative engine and playground for systems thinking.

I run **Arch Linux** on my daily driver — because I like to know how things work under the hood, and I enjoy the control, minimalism, and rolling-release philosophy. (Yes, I did survive the `pacman -Syu` gamble more than once 😅)

I believe in clean architecture, principled code, and learning by building — whether it’s an API, a neural net, or a pixel-perfect game mechanic.

### 🔧 What I'm up to:

- 🐹 Migrating my mindset from Java to **Go** — embracing simplicity, concurrency, and performance.
- 🧠 Studying **ML/DL** (scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch) and how to deploy models in production systems.
- 🎮 Building game prototypes in **Unreal Engine 5** with **C++** — from gameplay logic to custom engine plugins.
- 🌐 Expanding into frontend (React, TypeScript) to close the loop and become truly **Fullstack**.
- 🐧 Living the **Arch Linux** life — DIY, up-to-date, and unapologetically terminal-first.

### 🎯 Goals:

- Build end-to-end applications: from high-performance Go backends to responsive React frontends.
- Integrate ML models into real products — not just notebooks.
- Ship at least one polished game on Steam or itch.io 🚀
- Keep learning, keep shipping, and stay curious.
